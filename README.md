# Bitsocial Official Website

This repository contains the official Bitsocial web frontend.

It currently powers:
- the public landing page
- protocol documentation
- the Bitsocial apps & services explorer

Over time, this repository will evolve into the **flagship Bitsocial web client**, while the marketing and documentation content moves to subdomains (e.g. `about.bitsocial.net`).

**Live:** https://bitsocial.net

---

## Scope

**In scope**
- Public landing pages and protocol overview
- Apps & services catalog (`/apps`)
- Documentation frontend (`/docs`)
- Network status pages (`/status`)
- Shared UI, routing, and internationalization
- Performance-sensitive visualizations and animations

**Out of scope**
- Wallet integration
- Authentication / login flows
- Governance or voting UIs
- Token economics dashboards
- Backend services or indexers

This separation is intentional to keep the web frontend lightweight, durable, and relocatable as the ecosystem evolves.

## Getting Started

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) and [Portless](https://github.com/vercel-labs/portless): `npm install -g portless`

```bash
bun install          # Install dependencies
bun run dev          # Start dev server (http://bitsocial.localhost:1355)
bun run build        # Production build
bun run preview      # Preview production build
```

The dev server runs at http://bitsocial.localhost:1355 via [Portless](https://port1355.dev/), which gives each Bitsocial project a stable, named URL instead of a random port. To bypass Portless: `PORTLESS=0 bun run dev`

## Contributing
This repo includes an `AGENTS.md` file with detailed guidance for AI coding agents.

When using an AI assistant to make changes, it is expected to follow the conventions defined there.

### Making Changes
1.	Run `bun run dev` (opens at http://bitsocial.localhost:1355)
2.	Make your changes (manually or via an AI agent)
3.	Test on desktop and mobile viewports
4.	Verify performance and animations
5.	Run all quality checks before committing

### Code Quality
All checks must pass before committing:

```bash
bun run typecheck    # Type check with tsgo
bun run lint         # Lint with oxlint
bun run format:check # Check formatting with oxfmt
```

To auto-fix issues:

```bash
bun run lint:fix
bun run format
```

### Translations
We welcome translation improvements via PRs.

If you are improving an existing translation in your native language:
1.	Open `public/translations/{lang}/default.json` for your language.
2.	Edit only the string values for the keys you want to improve.
3.	Do not add, remove, or rename keys.
4.	Open a PR with just that language file updated.

If you need to add or remove keys across languages, use `scripts/update-translations.js`:

```bash
node scripts/update-translations.js --key my_new_key --map translations-temp.json --include-en --dry
node scripts/update-translations.js --key my_new_key --map translations-temp.json --include-en --write
node scripts/update-translations.js --key obsolete_key --delete --write
node scripts/update-translations.js --audit --dry
```

### Commits
This repo supports Commitizen for guided Conventional Commits.
Use `bun run commit` (or `bunx cz`) for the interactive prompt. `git commit` will also trigger Commitizen via Husky.

Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

-	`feat`: new features
-	`fix`: bug fixes
-	`perf`: performance improvements
-	`refactor`: refactors without behavior changes
-	`docs`: documentation changes
-	`style`: formatting only
-	`chore`: maintenance tasks

### Pre-PR Checklist

-	`bun run typecheck` passes
-	`bun run lint` passes
-	`bun run format:check` passes
-	Tested on mobile viewport
-	Animations are smooth and respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

## Roadmap for this repository

### Milestone #1: Frontpage

#### Topbar
- [x] Small size logo with no background, and logo text with official font (`Exo`)
- [x] Most important links, with underline animation
- [x] Language selector for as many languages as possible
- [x] Hamburger menu on mobile and mobile topbar design
- [ ] Dark/light theme button

#### Hero background graphic
- [x] Cool and impactful original hero background concept
- [x] 3D design and animation with three.js (planet graphic + p2p mesh graphic)
- [ ] Optional GSAP scroll animation (previous attempt was buggy, may revisit)
- [x] Static version for low-end devices and `prefers-reduced-motion`
- [x] Light and dark mode variants should look slightly different

#### Hero tagline text
- [x] Translated in all languages
- [x] Interactive keyword/key phrase jump to matching Core Features section

- [x] Initial card design (`S`-pattern)
- [x] Hash-link-friendly navigation to feature sections
- [x] "Learn more" expand button for each feature
- [x] GSAP animation for cards on scroll
- [ ] Fill expanded sections (or switch to full-page overlay pattern)
- [ ] Translate all expanded content
- [ ] Link each feature section to specific docs pages (card, expanded section, or both)

#### Master Plan section
- [x] Initial roadmap-like design
- [ ] Write each phase (concise and somewhat vague)
- [ ] Maybe add per-phase expand buttons (similar to Core Features)

- [ ] Visual quality comparable to topbar/hero, translucent design + static fallback for low-end devices
- [ ] Include all important links and mailing list field again

### Milestone #2: App Dashboard (`/apps`)

#### Goal
- Make it at least as good as [nostrapps.com](https://nostrapps.com/) while matching Bitsocial site design.

#### Scope
- [ ] Initial design similar to nostrapps.com, with Bitsocial visual language
- [ ] Categories and subcategories per app/client type (including profile-based, community-based, imageboard, blog, crowdfunding, indexers, RPC services)
- [ ] Keep useful categories visible even when empty, with translated descriptions
- [ ] Integrate lists from `bitsocialhq/lists`
- [ ] Add "submit your own" PR flow per category/subcategory
- [ ] Define and publish listing requirements

### Milestone #3: Docs (`/docs`)

#### Goal
- Build docs with strong LLM discoverability and scraping compatibility.

- [ ] Choose docs stack optimized for LLM scraping/indexing (e.g. Mintlify, GitBook, Docusaurus)
- [ ] Write essential docs first, expand over time
- [ ] Translate docs to all supported languages
- [ ] Add `/llms.txt`, `/llms-full.txt`, and `/llms-small.txt`
- [ ] Submit docs metadata to [llmstxt.cloud directory](https://directory.llmstxt.cloud/)

### Milestone #4: Status/Analytics Page (`/status`)

#### Goal
- Rebuild plebbit.online but fully rebranded and aligned with frontpage design.
- Position as "pro analytics" rather than a traditional "status page".

- [ ] Initialize status/analytics page from plebbit.online architecture, fully rebranded
- [ ] Categories and filters: default client list, merged/all lists view, and indexer-based discovery views
- [ ] Let users discover non-default subs (e.g. via ENS queries) with clear safety disclaimers
- [ ] Add ENS-query-based discovery list with explicit "search results may be unsafe" warning
- [ ] Consider "pro analytics" branding direction inspired by products like [Arkham](https://arkm.com/)
